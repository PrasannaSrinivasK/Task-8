# Task 8: Working with VPNs

## Objective  
Understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) work to protect privacy, encrypt online traffic, and hide the userâ€™s IP address.

## Tools Used  
- ProtonVPN (Free Tier) â€“ VPN client used  
- WhatIsMyIPAddress.com â€“ Used to verify IP address change  
- Firefox Browser â€“ For testing encrypted browsing

## Steps Performed

1. Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account.
2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN client on my system.
3. Connected to a free VPN server via ProtonVPN.
4. Verified that the IP address changed using [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com).
5. Browsed a few websites while the VPN was connected to confirm traffic encryption.
6. Disconnected the VPN and re-verified my original IP and network behavior.
7. Researched how VPN encryption works and how it helps protect online privacy.

## Key Observations

- New IP address was shown while VPN was active.
- Traffic remained encrypted and browsing was smooth.
- Minor reduction in browsing speed while connected.
- Upon disconnecting, IP and speed returned to normal.

## VPN Benefits

- Encrypts all internet traffic from the system.
- Hides real IP address and masks digital identity.
- Protects data over public Wi-Fi and untrusted networks.
- Prevents ISP and third-party tracking.

## VPN Limitations

- Free VPN servers can be slower due to limited bandwidth.
- VPN does not protect from malware or phishing attacks.
- Not all websites allow VPN access (may block some VPN IPs).
- VPN providers must be trusted (ProtonVPN has a no-log policy).

## Outcome  
Successfully installed and tested ProtonVPN, verified the encrypted connection and IP masking, and developed a deeper understanding of VPN security, privacy benefits, and limitations.
